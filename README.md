# Smartworks Tech Test

## Test 1 (HTML/CSS/JS)
* Look at the example form here: https://github.com/Smartwrks/tech-test/blob/master/resources/example-form.png
* Create the form in HTML. Use HTML5 elements as appropriate (responsiveness a plus)
* Style the form with CSS. Use SASS/LESS/PostCSS/Compass if desired
* Add form validation with JavaScript. Use jQuery/Angular/other framework as you feel comfortable.
* Style the error state as depicted, and the focused form element as depicted.

## Test 2 (Algorithm)
* Given an array of the numbers between 1..1000, create a simple program that does the following:
  * If the number is divisible by 3, output the string "fizz"
  * If the number is divisible by 5, output the string "buzz"
  * If the number is divisible by both 3 & 5, output the string "fizzbuzz"
  * If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, output the number
* Here is a starter jsfiddle if you would like to use JavaScript, but feel free to use any programming language you are comfortable with: https://jsfiddle.net/tq0ape12/

## Test 3 (Algorithm)
* Given an array of 50 numbers, including some duplicates, create a simple program that does the following:
  * Output an array of only the DUPLICATED numbers in the array.
  * Output an array of only the UNIQUE numbers in the array.
